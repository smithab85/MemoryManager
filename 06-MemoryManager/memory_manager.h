 * 
 * External (public) declarations for a memory manager in c.

/* mmInit()
 *     Initialize the memory manager to "manage" the given location
 *     in memory with the specified size.
 *         Parameters: start - the start of the memory to manage
 *                     size - the size of the memory to manage
 *         Returns: void

 *     Cleans up any storage used by the memory manager
 *     After a call to mmDestroy:
 *         all allocated spaces become invalid
 *         future allocation attempts fail
 *         future frees result in segmentation faults
 *     NOTE: after a call to mmDestroy a call to mmInit
 *           reinitializes the memory manager to allow allocations
 *           and frees
 *         Parameters: None
 *         Returns: void
